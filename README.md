# Generating the plot
These directions assume that one is working at the command line / terminal.

Clone the github repository, change into the repository directory, and start R:

```console
git clone https://github.com/MichaelHoltonPrice/OTML_season2_corp_stats
cd OTML_season2_corp_stats
R
```

Run the R script that generates the plot:

```console
source("bootstrap_scores.R")
```
